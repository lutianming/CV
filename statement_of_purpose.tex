\paragraph{}
About one year ago, I read a post about the free online courses. The machine learning class taught by Professor Andrew Ng attracted me and I signed in. In the class, there was a homework that asked us to recognize handwritten digits. At the same time, I was taking a course introducing multimedia and image. Solving image problems with machine learning techniques amazed me and I found it really interesting. Thus I begin to narrow my interests down to image process and machine learning and plan go further in these fields.

In the first two years of university study, I have gained lots of essential knowledge in math and software engineering. In the second grade, We had a statistics course. The knowledge I learned in the course is very useful in machine learning field. And it made my life easier when taking the online machine learning class. In the statistics course, we have some programming homework. Many students chose Java, which they were most familiar with, to do the homework. But I chose R, a new language I never used before, to finish the homework just because our professor mentioned that R is the language designed for statistics and I would like to try new things and take challenges. And happily, I got a score of 98 in this course.

I have already learned that French engineer education is rather efficient for training an elite in engineering. Students not only learn in class, but also learn in company. The theory and practice are highly combined with each other, which is proved to be an efficient way to learn and teach. As a result, being a student whose speciality is engineering, I believe France is a right choice for me to further my education. And ParisTech, with each school recognized as the best in its domain in France, is the place I should go without doubt. Especially, I find that Telecom ParisTech attracts me the most because of the Signal \& Image Process Department within it. The curriculum provided by the TSI department can meet my professional goals perfectly.
\paragraph{}
My professional goals are extremely clear. I plan to be a software engineer in image processing or machine learning fields after finishing my study. To reach my goal,  I asked to participate in the Seminar of Kinect and Depth Image when I was in third grade. The seminar was hold for graduate students in my institute. In the seminar, we read papers, made presentations and did research project. And during the seminar, I implemented a simple gesture recognition system. It was full of fun. I found there are four research groups in STI, telecom ParisTech. They all hold many interesting seminars. For example, Statistical Machine Learning in Paris hold by STA group. Besides the curriculum, these seminars would be great resource for me to learn advanced technology and I will be well prepared for my future career.

What's more, I would like to be a kind of engineer that can help people solve real problems and make their life better. To gain more practical skills and understand the industry, I became an intern in Microsoft, China. And my job in the internship period is to build a tool to help developers finish job faster and easier. The tool was not very hard to implement, but it is really useful. The department I worked in is the most burdensome one, and my mentor nearly have lots of work to do all the time. And this tool can help them save lots of time. When I see my job can make others more efficient and relaxed, I feel a sense of accomplishment(I attached the internship performance assessment after this statement for reference).
\paragraph{}   
During the past several years of study, I have built a strong base for my future career. I have learned lots of basic knowledge in fields of engineering, image processing and machine learning. But I still feel that the knowledge I have gained is not enough and I need further education. The curriculum provided by the TSI department can meet my requirement perfectly. The curriculum includes image, multimedia, machine learning, data mining and so on. These courses are what I want to learn and perfectly satisfy my professional goals. It can help me fill the gap between general knowledge and specialized knowledge. This is what ParisTech can help me.
