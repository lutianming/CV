\paragraph{}
I can still remember that in the first class of Software Engineering, our professor told us that software is one of the most complex systems in the world and our duty is to make functional, powerful and reliable software that can make people's life better. In the first two years of university study, I have gained lots of essential knowledge in computer science and software engineering, such as data structure, algorithm and design pattern. In the third year, I chose Multimedia as my main direction. And now I narrow my interests down to image process and machine learning.

I have already learnt that French engineer education is rather efficient for training an elite in engineering. Students not only learn in class, but also learn in company, the theory and practice are highly combined with each other. What is more, With the support of CTI, engineer education in French can achieve effective quality assurance . As a result, being a student whose speciality is engineering, I believe French is a right choice for me to further my education. especially, I find that Telecom ParisTech attracts me the most because of Signal \& Image Process Department within it.

My professional goals are extremely clear. I plan to be a software engineering in image processing or machine learning fields, after finishing my study. I would like to be a kind of engineer that can find solutions to help companies make more profit and help employees save time. Three months experience of internship in Microsoft, China help me not only gain lots of practical skills, but also understand this industry. The department I worked in is the most burdensome one, and my mentor nearly have lots of work to do all the time. And my job in the internship period is to build tools to help them finish job faster and easier. When I see my job can make others more efficient and relaxed, I feel a sense of accomplishment. That is why I want be an engineer solving real problems.

During the past several years of study, I have built a strong base for my future career. I know how software works and how to make it more reliable and friendly. Because image processing is my interest, I asked to participate the Kinect Depth Image Seminar which was designed for graduate students in my institute. But I still feel that I do not have enough knowledge in this field. The curriculum provided by the TSI department includes image, multimedia, machine learning, data mining and so on. All these courses perfectly satisfy my professional goals. It can help me fill the gap between general knowledge and specialized knowledge. This is what ParisTech can help me.
