About one year ago, I read a post about the free online courses, which is known as Coursera today. The machine learning class taught by Professor Andrew Ng attracted me and I signed in. In the class, there was a programming assignment that asked us to recognize handwritten digits. At the same time, I was taking a course introducing multimedia and image in my institute. Solving image problems with machine learning techniques amazed me and I found it really interesting. Thus I began to narrow my interests down to image process and machine learning.

I know that French engineer education is rather efficient for training an elite in engineering. Students not only learn in class, but also learn in company. The theory and practice are highly combined with each other, which is proved to be an efficient way to learn and teach. Thus, being a student whose major is engineering, I believe France is a right place for me to further my education. And ParisTech, with each school recognized as the best in its domain in France, is the first choice for me. Especially, I find that Telecom ParisTech attracts me the most because of the Signal \& Image Process Department within it. The curriculum provided by the TSI department includes image, multimedia, machine learning and so on. These courses can meet my personal interests and professional goals perfectly.

In the first two years of university study, I have gained lots of essential knowledge in math and software engineering. This is the base of my future career. In the second grade, We had a statistics course. In this course, we have some programming assignments. Many students chose Java, which they were most familiar with, to do the assignment. But I chose R, a new language I never used before, because our professor mentioned in class that R is the language designed for statistical computing. Though I need to learn a new programming language from scratch, I really enjoy the process. And happily, I got a score of 98 in this course finally.

My professional goals are extremely clear. I plan to be a software engineer in image processing or machine learning fields. To reach my goal,  I asked to participate in the Seminar of Kinect and Depth Image when I was in third grade. The seminar was hold for graduate students in my institute. In the seminar, we read papers, made presentations and did research project. And during the seminar, I implemented a simple gesture recognition system. It was full of fun. I found there are four research groups in the STI department, telecom ParisTech. They all organize many interesting seminars. For example, The STA group holds a seminar called Statistical Machine Learning in Paris. Besides the curriculum, these seminars would be great resource for me to learn advanced technology that is useful for my future career.

What's more, I would like to be a kind of engineer that can help people solve real problems and make their life better. During my internship in Microsoft, China, I built a tool to help developers finish job faster and easier. This tool can help them save lots of time. When I see my job makes others' life easier, I feel a sense of accomplishment(I attached the internship performance assessment after this statement for reference).
\paragraph{}   
During the past three years of study, I have built a strong base for my future career. But that is still not enough for me and I want to be more professional. The curriculum provided by the TSI department in Telecom ParisTech includes a perfect combination of image process and machine learning. It can help me become more professional in the fields. And I am well prepared for the future challenge.
