\paragraph{}
I can still remember that in the first class of Software Engineering, our professor told us that software is one of the most complex systems in the world and our duty is to make functional, powerful and reliable software that can make people's life better. In the first two years of university study, I have gained lots of essential knowledge in computer science and software engineering, such as data structure, algorithm and design pattern. Gradually, I began to show interest in finding information in images. As a result, in the third year, I chose Multimedia as my main direction. And now I narrow my interests down to image process and machine learning.
And the more I know in this field, the stronger I feel that the knowledge in my undergraduate period is not enough at all. Thus, I plan to further my education. 
\paragraph{}
I have already learned that French engineer education is rather efficient for training an elite in engineering. Students not only learn in class, but also learn in company. The theory and practice are highly combined with each other, which is proved to be an efficient way to learn and teach. What is more, With the support of CTI, engineer education in France can achieve effective quality assurance. As a result, being a student whose speciality is engineering, I believe France is a right choice for me to further my education. And ParisTech, with each school recognized as the best in its domain in France, is the place I should go without doubt. Especially, I find that Telecom ParisTech attracts me the most because of the Signal \& Image Process Department within it. The curriculum provided by the TSI department can meet my professional goals perfectly.
\paragraph{}
My professional goals are extremely clear. I plan to be a software engineer in image processing or machine learning fields after finishing my study. To reach my goal, when I was in third grade, I asked to participate in the Seminar of Kinect and Depth Image, which was hold for graduate students in my institute. In the seminar, we read papers, made presentations and did research project. And during the seminar, I implemented a simple gesture recognition system. It was full of fun. I found there are four research groups in STI, telecom ParisTech. They all hold many interesting seminars. For example, Statistical Machine Learning in Paris hold by STA group. Besides the curriculum, these seminars would be great resource for me to learn advanced technology and I will be well prepared for my future career.

What's more, I would like to be a kind of engineer that can help people solve real problems and make their life better. To gain more practical skills and understand the industry, I became an intern in Microsoft, China. And my job in the internship period is to build a tool to help developers finish job faster and easier. The tool was not very hard to implement, but it is really useful. The department I worked in is the most burdensome one, and my mentor nearly have lots of work to do all the time. And this tool can help them save lots of time. When I see my job can make others more efficient and relaxed, I feel a sense of accomplishment(I attached the internship performance assessment after this statement for reference).
\paragraph{}   
During the past several years of study, I have built a strong base for my future career. I have learned lots of basic knowledge in fields of engineering, image processing and machine learning. But I still feel that the knowledge I have gained is not enough and I need further education. The curriculum provided by the TSI department can meet my requirement perfectly. The curriculum includes image, multimedia, machine learning, data mining and so on. These courses are what I want to learn and perfectly satisfy my professional goals. It can help me fill the gap between general knowledge and specialized knowledge. This is what ParisTech can help me.
