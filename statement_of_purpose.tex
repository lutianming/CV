\paragraph{Introductory statement: Write a short summary of your studies including fields and areas of specialization}
I still remember that in the first class of Software Engineering, our professor told us that software is one of the most complex systems in the world and our duty is to make functional, powerful and reliable software that can make people's life better. After three years study, I have gained lots of essential knowledge in computer science and software engineering, such as data structure, algorithm, design pattern. And now I narrow my interests down to intelligent software system using technique such as machine learning and data mining.
\paragraph{2}
I have already learnt that French engineer education is rather efficient for training an elite in engineering. With the support of CTI, engineer education can achieve effective quality assurance. And because students not only learn in class, but also learn in company, the theory and practice are highly combined with each other. As a result, being a student majoring in engineering, I believe French is a right choice for me to further my education. especially, I found that Telecom ParisTech emphasize on both Information Technology and Computer science. I think those two fields interact with each other and they are all important in my future career, thus a school whit both emphasises attracts me a lot. 
\paragraph{professional goals}
Without doubt, I plan to be a software engineering, especially in intelligent system field, after finishing my study. Three months experience of internship in Microsoft, China help me not only gain lots of practical skills, but also understand this industry. The department I worked in is the most burdensome one, and my mentor nearly have lots of work to do all the time. And my job in the internship period is to build tools to help them finish job faster and easier. When I see my job can make others more efficient and relaxed, I feel a sense of accomplishment. Thus, I would like to be a kind of engineer that can find solutions to help companies make more profit and help employees save time.
\paragraph{study and ParisTech}   
During the past several years of study, I have built a strong base for my future career. I know how software works and how to make it more reliable and friendly. But I still feel that I do not have enough knowledge in a specific field. And this is what ParisTech can help me. The ParisTech's curriculum can help me fill the gap between general knowledge and specialized knowledge.
